# Web-Shop

**Web-Shop** is a project where I developed the interface of an online store, focusing on clean architecture, modern design, and full responsiveness.  
The goal was not just to build a static page, but to demonstrate how to structure a scalable frontend architecture where every element is a meaningful component.

The project is built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** - a tech stack that enables fast, flexible, and well-structured interface development.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and SEO optimization with Next.js
- **Static typing and development-time validation** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and maintainable UI styling
- Fully responsive layout for all devices
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- Structured sections: promotional banners, product cards, and featured items


## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** — React framework with built-in SSR and SSG support
- **TypeScript** — typed superset of JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first CSS framework
- **Vercel** — deployment platform (optional)
